With members coming and going, our platforms and applications remain cluttered with inactive members. We are unsure of who is still a member and who has left. This outline is to ensure a smooth transition for both the offboarding member and the people team when members decide to leave. 

DRI: @winniezhang-23

- DRI please review the eduflow for more clarification
