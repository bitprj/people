# 1st Round of Peer Review

## Getting Your Slides Ready for Peer Review
  - [ ] Send the link of your draft to the team
  - [ ] Let the team know that you are ready for your first round of peer review 
  
## Things to Consider when Peer Reviewing Other's Work
  - [ ] Imagine yourself as a student in that grade level, will you be able to understand the language and concepts taught in the slides?
  - [ ] Mention how can EACH part of EACH slide be improved
  - [ ] Pay attention to grammar, punctuation, sentence structure, diction, clarity...
  
## Fixing Your Own Slides
  - [ ] Resolve peer review comments on all 3 grade versions
  - [ ] If your peer review comments something only in one of the three versions, but you know that comment or edit can be applied to all three versions, donâ€™t forget to change it in all three versions.
