- The big picture thing is still not so clear, should be more interact in the team meetings as well

- Don’t see much of what a project as a whole is going on 

- New members don’t know what the team has done in the past and need more explanations to be on the same page with other people in the team. 

- Need to figure out a better way to communicate with new members, so when they join teams they don’t feel lost.

- There aren't many explanations of why certain projects are assigned to someone, just assigned in slack. And there is also a lot of change in formatting. Just need more explanations before a certain action is taken.

- Team members need to see the road map

- There seem to be discrepancies in what we were being told to do versus what Kevin had on the developer bible. The developer bible needs to be up to date.

- For new members, explaining is really important.
