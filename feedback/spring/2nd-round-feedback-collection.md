# Feedbacks Week April 20 - 26

## Workflow when collecting feedbacks

**TEAM MEETING**

How is your communication between each other? How do you guys feel about being in this team?

Is there any misunderstanding about assigning works? Do you all know what you need to work on?

Do you guys have anything that you noticed isnâ€™t going well, or do you have any concerns or frustrations going on right now?

Is there anything that has been going well in your team? That you suggest other groups could also do it?

Is there anything that is getting better but still needs more work on?

**NEW MEMBER**

Is there any new member in the team? 

How was your onboarding experience? 

What do you think about the work loaded?  

Do you have any suggestions that could make our onboarding process better? It could be anything that you have noticed that was unclear or confuses you.

Do you all have other things to comment on?

*Attend weekly meetings and list the feedbacks down here by CATEGORIES*

* OKRs are helpful since it gave a clear direction of what need to complete in a week and also in a month, helps with time management. 

**GitHub Issue**
* A lot of people have point out that navigating GitHub is really hard. Suggestion: have a simpler to-do app that could have people assign work and have a clear calendar with all the assignments need to be done would be really helpful. Also simplify the meeting notes template. 


**Onboarding**
* New members suggest to condense the content of the webinars to make it shorter. (Diversity and feedback webinars had been point out)

* Extend the dealine to complete the onboarding process, the work is hard to complete in 3-4 days. 
*Suggestion: seperate the onboarding process into different parts, so new members don't see a big list of tasks that need to be complete and get scared. Give an appropriate timeline to finish each part. When finished, check in with their managers and managers could give them the 2nd part.*

* The template of onboarding should be simplified into the lead part and member part. Before the onboarding lead to actually onboarding someone, it would be helpful to have a meeting with the lead to go through the checklist first.

**Outreach**
* IMC: Twitter team is concerned about when contacting the professors, they are not replying. 
* PrimaryEd: Parents that we reach out for feedback are not answering us. My teammate points out that we could have a simpler google form that contains short answers which only take about 2 minutes to fill out.

**Writing Team**
* So far, the directions of the tasks being assigned weren't really clear, so there is a lot of confusion during the process of completing the tasks. They suggest that having all the directions and goals either written on a list or discussed during a meeting would be really helpful for everyone in the team.
