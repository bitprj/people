# Feedbacks Week April 20 - 26

## Workflow when collecting feedbacks

**TEAM MEETING**

How is your communication between each other? How do you guys feel about being in this team?

Is there any misunderstanding about assigning works? Do you all know what you need to work on?

Do you guys have anything that you noticed isnâ€™t going well, or do you have any concerns or frustrations going on right now?

Is there anything that has been going well in your team? That you suggest other groups could also do it?

Is there anything that is getting better but still needs more work on?

**NEW MEMBER**

Is there any new member in the team? 

How was your onboarding experience? 

What do you think about the work loaded?  

Do you have any suggestions that could make our onboarding process better? It could be anything that you have noticed that was unclear or confuses you.

Do you all have other things to comment on?

*Attend weekly meetings and list the feedbacks down here by CATEGORIES*

**Writing Team**
* So far, the directions of the tasks being assigned weren't really clear, so there is a lot of confusion during the process of completing the tasks. They suggest that having all the directions and goals either written on a list or discussed during a meeting would be really helpful for everyone in the team
* They felt that navigating the GitHub was still kind of hard for non-technical people, even with the tutorial. Since everyone has a tight schedule, it would be hard to have more time to practice using it.
* Onboarding process was really detailed and having a lot of information actually helped to learn more about the Bit Project. But the Webinars are kind of long, and they suggest condense the content to make it shorter. (Especially the diversity and feedback one)
* The template of onboarding is kind of unclear, it is very long and hard to figure out which one is for the lead and which one is for the member. Before the onboarding lead to actually onboarding someone, it would be helpful to have a meeting with the lead to go through the checklist first.


**Engineering Team**
* The new member of the engineering department suggested having a tutorial on MDX.
