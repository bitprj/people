- (Victoria) There are too many tight deadlines, especially for boot camp curriculum, which was assigned late by Daniel and/or Kevin. The work itself isn't intensive, but going through and reading every file is time-consuming. I would prefer if the deadlines were spaced out as much as they can in the time we have until students in the boot camp reach the modules I'm editing. I'd like for whoever's working with me to keep in mind that I'm currently taking 6 classes and have a part-time job; although both are remote, they still take up as much time as they would in-person, and that affects how much time I can give to Bit.

- (Rochelle) The slides used for boot camps and/or webinars have too much unnecessary text and thus are very time-consuming to edit. The solution (if powerpoints are the only medium) would be to proofread and eliminate any unnecessary content-related things. However, due to the amount of info we need to cover, it seems that we should probably switch to or add another medium to our teaching methods.

- None of the people know what a road map is.
